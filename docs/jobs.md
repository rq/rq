For some use cases it might be useful have access to the current job ID or
instance from within the job function itself.  Or to store arbitrary data on
jobs.


## Accessing the "current" job

_New in version 0.3.3._

Since job functions are regular Python functions, you have to ask RQ for the
current job ID, if any.  To do this, you can use:

{% highlight python %}
from rq import get_current_job

def add(x, y):
    job = get_current_job()
    print 'Current job: %s' % (job.id,)
    return x + y
{% endhighlight %}


## Storing arbitrary data on jobs

_New in version 0.3.3._

To add/update custom status information on this job, you have access to the
`meta` property, which allows you to store arbitrary pickleable data on the job
itself:

{% highlight python %}
import socket

def add(x, y):
    job = get_current_job()
    job.meta['handled_by'] = socket.gethostname()
    job.save()
    return x + y
{% endhighlight %}
